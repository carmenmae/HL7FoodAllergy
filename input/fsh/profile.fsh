Profile:     FoodAllergy
Id:          FoodAllergyProfile
Parent:      AllergyIntolerance
Title:       "Food Allergy profile"
Description: "Food allergy profile for reported food allergies"
// The `Title` keyword defines the human-readable title on the profile's page in the built
// Implementation Guide. This is also visible in on the Artifacts page and in the Table of Contents
// in the built Implementation Guide.
//
// The `Description` keyword defines a short summary of the profile that appears at the top of the
// profile page under "Definition" and on the Artifacts page in the built Implementation Guide.
//
// Note that FSH files do not typically have extra white space between rules, but due to the large
// number of comments in this example, extra white space is included for better readability.

// ----- Begin rules:

// Require at least one value inside the `name` element
* name 1..*

// Mark elements as MustSupport
*patient MustSupport
* code 1..1
*clinicalStatus 1..1
*recordedDate MustSupport

*participant 

*participant contains recorder 0..1 and asserter 0..1

*participant[recorder]
  * function - #enter

  *participant[asserter]
  * function - #informant

// Provide custom prose descriptions of the `name` element:
//
// The contents of `^short` appears in the "Description & Constraints" column in the differential or
// snapshot tables of a built Implementation Guide.
//
// The `^definition` displays when clicking on an element's name in the differential or snapshot
// tables when building a built Implementation Guide. This can also be accessed in the "Detailed
// Descriptions" tab on a profile page.
* name ^short = "Official name (i.e., legal name) of patient"

// in the built Implementation Guide.
